# API & Controllers

## API Endpoints

The application provides the following API endpoints defined in [app.py](mdc:app.py):

- `GET /` - Serves the main application page
- `POST /api/process` - Processes medical text and returns structured data
- `POST /api/validate` - Validates specific fields in the medical text

## Controllers

### OpenAI Controller

The [OpenAI Controller](mdc:app/controllers/openai_controller.py) handles communication with Azure OpenAI:

- Initializes Azure OpenAI client with API credentials
- Processes medical text using a specialized prompt
- Returns structured JSON data from the OpenAI response

### Mock Controller

For testing purposes, the application can use a mock controller when:
- The `USE_MOCK` environment variable is set to "true"
- Required Azure OpenAI environment variables are missing

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables loaded from a `.env` file:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for Azure OpenAI
- `USE_MOCK` - Flag to use mock controller for testing
