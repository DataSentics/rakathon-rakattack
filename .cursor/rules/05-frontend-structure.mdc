# Frontend Structure

## HTML Template

The main application interface is defined in [app/templates/index.html](mdc:app/templates/index.html). Key features include:

- Two main screens: text input and results display
- Patient information card with timeline visualization
- Split-view display showing original text and analysis results
- Loading spinner for async operations

## JavaScript Logic

The frontend functionality is implemented in [app/static/js/main.js](mdc:app/static/js/main.js). Key functions include:

- `processText()` - Sends text to the backend for processing
- `handleProcessSuccess()` - Handles successful API responses
- `generateTimeline()` - Creates a visual timeline from extracted dates
- `displayResults()` - Renders the structured JSON data
- `searchAndHighlightText()` - Highlights matching text in the original document

## UI Flow

1. User enters medical text in the input screen
2. On submission, a loading spinner appears during processing
3. Results are displayed in a split view:
   - Left side shows the original text
   - Right side shows the structured data
4. Clicking on timeline elements highlights relevant text in the original document
