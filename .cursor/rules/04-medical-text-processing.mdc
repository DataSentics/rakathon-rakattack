# Medical Text Processing

## Medical Prompt

The application uses a specialized prompt defined in [app/prompts/medical_text_prompt.py](mdc:app/prompts/medical_text_prompt.py) for processing Czech cancer treatment reports. The prompt:

- Instructs the AI to analyze Czech oncological medical records
- Extracts structured information into a specific JSON format
- Includes reference information like MKN-10 codes for diseases
- Handles dates and events in a standardized format

## Required Fields

The application validates that specific required fields are present in the AI response. These fields are defined in the `REQUIRED_FIELDS` dictionary in [app.py](mdc:app.py).

Key sections include:
- Administrative data (`administrativni_udaje`)
- Patient parameters (`modul_a_pacient_parametry`)
- Diagnostic information (`modul_b_cast_b1`)
- Treatment information (`modulc_dospelionk_pac`)

## Data Validation

The application validates the structured data in several ways:
- Checks for missing required fields using the `validate_required_fields` function
- Provides field validation through the `/api/validate` endpoint
- Returns information about missing fields to guide the user on what additional data is needed
